Black-Scholes

Standard Black-Scholes option pricing assumes constant volatility and log-normal distributions of underlying asset returns. 
In BS model, theoretical value of a vanilla option is a monotonic increasing function of the volatility of the undelying asset. 


See stochastic volatility models and local volatility models for improvements.


Monte Carlo simulation tend to be more effective when 3 or more stochastic variables are used. Because computation time increases linearly in Monte Carlo simulations and increase exponentially for most of other simulation methods.
