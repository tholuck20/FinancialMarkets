+DELTA Measures dividend risk and equity risk:
The delta of the option is the amount of equity market exposure an option has. As a stock price falls by the dividend 
amount on its ex-date, delta is equal to the exposure to dividends that go ex before expiry. 
The dividend risk is equal to the negative of the delta. 

+DELTA IS NOT THE PROBABILITY OPTION EXPIRES ITM
It is for digital option (binary option). The probability of such an option expiring ITM is equal to delta, as the payoff 
only depends on it being ITM or not (the size of the payment does not change with how much ITM spot is). 
For a vanilla option, there is a difference but this difference is typically small unless the maturity of the option is very long. 

Delta takes into account the mamount an option can be ITM.
Call can have infinite payoff, put's maximum value is the strike (as spot cannot go below zero). The delta hedge has to take this
into account so:
  Call delta      >  Probability call ends up ITM
  ABS(Put delta)  <  Probability put ends up ITM
  
+Stock replacing via calls/puts benefits from convexity:
A call option is convex: delta increases as spot increases and decreases as spot decreases. 
This means that losses are smaller and returns are bigger. 
The downside of using calls is that the position will give a wore profile than the original long stock position if the underlying 
does not move much (because of time value: as cal options will fall each day by the theta if spot remains unchanged). 
Using calls is best when implied volatility is cheap and the investor expects the stock to move by more than currently implied (logique
étant donné que la volatilité actuelle est prise en compte dans le prix de l'option, pour gagner il faut que la volatilité "réelle" soit 
plus importante).
